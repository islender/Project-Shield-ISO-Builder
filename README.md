# SMG Nvidia Shield for Wii ISO builder

I lost the source code for this, however the "compiled" version (this was made in bash) is linked here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJMQoGmalYm5zAWYzVQaXWnQavDcVE6f/view

Grab your Super Mario Galaxy (any region) disc image and plop it into the program, configure some settings then it will dump you your new ISO or WBFS
