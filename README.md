# SMG Nvidia Shield for Wii ISO builder

Features some upscaled textures to 4k, and also assembly hacks to try to as closely match the Shield release of Super Mario Galaxy as possible. The language is also in the original Chinese

I lost the source code for this, however the "compiled" version (this was made in bash) is linked here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJMQoGmalYm5zAWYzVQaXWnQavDcVE6f/view

Grab your Super Mario Galaxy (any region) disc image and plop it into the program, configure some settings then it will dump you your new ISO or WBFS
